[Mantella](http://mantella.info/) is an efficiency-focused C++ header-only library for analysing and solving optimisation problems.

It is written in C++14 and only depends on the C++ standard library, supporting Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

**Our goal is to make optimisation processes as easy as writing**

``` cpp
#include <mantella>

int main() {
  // ... company code.

  // Adds your own optimisation problem.
  constexpr std::size_t number_of_dimensions = 2;
  mant::optimisation_problem<double, number_of_dimensions> my_problem;
  my_problem.objective_functions.push_back({
    [](const auto& parameter) {
      return my_objective_value_computation(parameter);
    },
    "My problem"
  });
  
  // Optimises the problem. Selects and parametrises an efficient optimiser automatically.
  auto result = mant::optimise(my_problem);

  // ... continuing company code.
  
  return 0;
}
```

**while (automatically) analysing and learning the problems properties over time, in order to select the most efficient solver to do the job.**
